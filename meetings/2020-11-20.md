### We should we squash the index?
  
  * Consider different tool than Git (large effort).
  * Consider grafts on history (moderate effort).
  * Branching strategy (master as all history and current with single or minimal commits).
  * Leverage a background job and run it more often to rebuild the index.

### How do we handle deleted GH accounts?

  * /u/{cratesio-id}/{github-username} is the suggested approach
  * need implementation work

### Ensure the update job doesn't run concurrently
  
  * swirl can't help us here.
  * If someone can review the related PRs jtgeibel will merge.
