# crates-io-cargo-teams
the home of the crates io and cargo teams

This repo is where the crates-io and cargo teams organize. RFCs and meeting agendas, as well as policy and planning documents, live here.

### crates.io team

The crates-io team meets every Thursday at 4pm ET (20:00 UTC) in the #infra/crates-io channel on the Rust discord and anyone may attend to observe. About once a month, the meeting will be a video call by invite only, announced the previous week.
